Current Hospital Capacity Estimates – Snapshot

Estimates of hospital capacity were available at the national and state levels. These estimates used data that hospitals submitted to the NHSN COVID-19 Module and statistical methods that included weighting (to account for non-response) and multiple imputation (to account for missing data). The estimates (number and percentage) are shown along with 95% confidence intervals that reflect random error.


IMPORTANT: Data displayed on this page was submitted directly to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and does not include data submitted to other entities contracted by or within the federal government.

The following downloadable file contains national and state estimates from the NHSN COVID-19 Module. This file will not be updated after July 14, 2020 and includes data from April 1 to July 14.

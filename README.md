Current Hospital Capacity Estimates – Snapshot

Estimates of hospital capacity were available at the national and state levels. These estimates used data that hospitals submitted to the NHSN COVID-19 Module and statistical methods that included weighting (to account for non-response) and multiple imputation (to account for missing data). The estimates (number and percentage) are shown along with 95% confidence intervals that reflect random error.


IMPORTANT: Data displayed on this page was submitted directly to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and does not include data submitted to other entities contracted by or within the federal government.

The following downloadable file contains national and state estimates from the NHSN COVID-19 Module. This file will not be updated after July 14, 2020 and includes data from April 1 to July 14.

Percentage of Inpatient Beds Occupied by COVID-19 Patients – Change in 14 Day Period

The average daily change in percentage of inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients in a state was estimated using statistical regression methods.  The percentage of inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients on a given date was based on a 3-day moving average, to minimize random fluctuations in bed counts.

State estimates of change in percentage, with 95% confidence intervals that reflect sampling errors, were based on data submitted by acute care hospitals to the NHSN COVID-19 Module.

Estimates obtained from regression models were adjusted for hospital size, facility type, and the percentage of facilities participating daily in NHSN COVID-19 Module.

The following downloadable file contains 14-day change estimates of percentage of inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients for individual states. This file will not be updated after July 14, 2020 and includes data for two consecutive 14-day time periods from the most recent 28 days.
